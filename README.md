# 2023-2024-chrome-extension-blocker

A newly made Chrome extension blocker made by me for the 2023 school year! By re-engineering the LTBEEF inspect element exploit and turning it into a interactable UI that is working as of aug-22-23 to block extensions. 


## Instructions


Go to this link in your Chrome browser. chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/manifest.json (maybe bookmark this to get to it easily)

then go to this link in a new tab and copy the contents. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mrnuke000/ChromBlock/main/Main.js  (I would also bookmark this)

now go back to the first tab and copy the code into the inspect element console, this will open a UI that you can use to control the extensions of your computer, even admin installed ones! Enjoy!
